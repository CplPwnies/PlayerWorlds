Welcome to neo ORPG Closed Alpha! You have been chosen as my close friend, so I would hope that you would test everything you can think of. Please note the Bug report feature DOES NOT report bugs to me, it is a per-server feature! To report bugs, please visit http://www.neoorpg.com and join the forums and the bug tracker. Post bugs that you find and I will fix them as soon as I can. Again, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to test this for me, and please give me your honest opinion. On a side note, please use neo ORPG-V.exe before anything. if you recieve a runtime error, use Neo ORPG-S.exe. the V version uses Video memory for DirectX functions, however this can cause errors on some systems, but will reduce memory usage. if you get an RTE, use the S client, which uses System Memory, just like Playerworlds. Again, thank you, and good luck testing! -Magnus
