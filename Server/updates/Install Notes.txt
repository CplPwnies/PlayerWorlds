Here is a list of items that must be changed in order to merge the Auto Patcher into 
your game.  Any problems, email x-net@swbell.net


1. Cancel Button:  Unload the starting form since this form was called from it.

2. Done Button: Make your starting form visible after patching is done

3. General > VerifyDirectorys Function:  Place any directorys you wish to have created if a (new game install) in this function to avoid errors

4. General > Declaractions:  Change the Web server to the web address you will be using that holds your update files

5. General > StartUpdate:  Add your games main form to the error handler unload statement


After changing these 5 areas,  You SHOULD put the autopatcher in your main forms
Form_Load as it looks below.  Run it first before you do anything else.  


Private Sub Form_Load()
  frmMain.Visible = False 'First Line
  frmAutoPatcher.Show 'Second Line
  ..Rest of your load Code..
End Sub

OK NOW TO EXPLAIN THE UPDATE.TXT FILE!


Welcome to YOUR online game.  Checking for updates, please stand by.
\maps\map_0.dat, map_0.xvx, 1/20/01 1:47:21 AM, http://www.yoursite.com/files/map_0.dat
\maps\map_1.dat, map_1.xvx, 1/20/01 1:47:21 AM, http://www.yoursite.com/files/map_1.dat
\maps\map_2.dat, map_2.xvx, 1/20/01 1:47:21 AM, http://www.yoursite.com/files/map_2.dat
\maps\map_3.dat, map_3.xvx, 1/20/01 1:47:21 AM, http://www.yoursite.com/files/map_3.dat



Ok first some basic rules in creating this update.txt file..  I suggest using windows
notepad and turning OFF wordwrap (Edit>Word Wrap).  It's very important that you follow
the exact structure or you will error out..


The first line is the NEWS or Message of the day, Use it to display any changes to your
game or just to say hi.  This has to be on the first line.
1: "Welcome to YOUR Online game.  Checking for updates, please stand by."


Ok now lets break down the actual Meat of the file update lines. The rest of the lines
are the actual update information.  Each line represents one file to update/patch.
\maps\map_0.dat, map_0.xvx, 1/20/01 1:47:21 AM, http://www.yoursite.com/files/map_0.dat

This update.txt downloads 4 new or modified map files.  There is 4 sections per line
split with a comma and space ", ".  The first part "\maps\map_0.dat" is the actual
location this file will be downloaded to using the App.Path as the root.  So if your game is in
C:\MYGAME,  It will download to C:\MYGAME\MAPS\MAP_0.DAT.  


The second part  map_0.xvx   is the name of the file that gets stored in the App.Path\update
directory.  These files are timestamped.  the filename must be named the same as the actual
file you are updating but with the .xvx extension.  These files are used to keep track of 
what updates the player has already downloaded.  


The Third Part   1/20/01 1:47:21 AM  is the timestamp (time) you posted the file.  If at anytime you
make a new update available, just change this to the current time and when people log into
your game, it will compare the new time to the old updated time and download all files that
have different times.  MAKE sure you use this time Format


The Forth and Final Part     http://www.yoursite.com/files/map_0.dat
This is the actual location the updater can find the file.  

Keep it in this format and you won't have any problems..  



=============================================================================

NOW THE LAST BUT MOST IMPORTANT THING!!!

Ok when you are done modifying/creating a update.txt file in NOTEPAD.  BEFORE you save it,
You MUST place your cursor right below the last line of text.  Make Sense?  If you don't it 
will error out because all the information is parsed with vbCrLf and counted.  So before you,
Make it look like this
